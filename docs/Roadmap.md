# Interview Prep

## Tips

- system design
    - basic distributed computing concepts

- common data structures
    - usages, pros and cons, etc

- Research scalability concepts and technology
    - caching
    - load balancing
    - non-relational databases
    - mirco services
    - sharding

- OS topics
    - memory management
    - processes
    - threads
    - synchronization
    - paging
    - multithreading

- Be familiar and ready to solve in-depth technical questions on concepts like data structures and algorithms. This will likely include qualifying requirements, checking edge cases and white boarding your solutions with our engineers.

- Visit codechef.com or similar websites to brush up on problem solving and core CS fundamentals. "Cracking the Coding Interview" is a good read.

## Whiteboarding

- Write a list of requirements on the board, and keep asking questions.

- Practice writing code and system design out by hand. Consider a scalable code or design before you begin drafting.

- Keep the customer front of mind.
    - Who is the customer, and what problem are you solving for them? Dig for clarification.

- Start with shapes to represent different software components and data sources, and then arrows connecting them to show web services, APIs and interactions between components.

- Scaling is a critical component of software design. Consider:
    - software components
    - how to store data
    - APIs
    - component relationships
    - data flows.

- When diagramming and designing your software systems, be familiar with:
    - Distributed Systems
    - SOA
    - n-tiered software architecture.

- Operational performance of your design is important.
    - How will you ensure this system is working at an acceptable level of performance?
    - If a problem occurs, what will be involved to trouble shoot and resolve quickly?
    - What are the possible points of failure and how can they be made more robust against failure?
